# Computor-V1

The purpose of this project is to make you code a program that solves simple equations. The program takes a polynomial equation. That is to say, involving only powers, no complicated functions. The program should display its solution(s). Why polynomials? Because it is one of the simplest and most powerful mathematical tools. It is used in all domains and at all levels to simplify and express many things. For example, the functions sin, cos, and tan are computed using polynomials.

# Objectives

Write a program that solves a polynomial equation of degree less than or equal to 2. You
will need to display at least:
• The reduced form of the equation.
• The degree of the equation.
• Its solution(s), as well as the sign of the discriminant when it makes sense.
